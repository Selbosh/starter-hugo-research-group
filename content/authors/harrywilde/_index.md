Harrison is a second year PhD student in Statistics supervised primarily by Sebastian Vollmer at the DFKI (German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence). He is the 2019 recipient of the Feuer International Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence and a 2019 Data Science for Social Good Fellow. He continues to support the fellowship and foundation as one of the principal organisers and reviewers for the UK programme.

His research interests include Bayesian computation, learning and modelling theory and methodology with applications in epidemiology, medicine and public health, as well as synthetic data generation, fairness and privacy across these contexts.

He mainly works with collaborators across the University of Oxford, UCL and The Wellcome Trust, as a current research scientist intern at Twitter Cortex, a visiting member of Chris Holmes' lab at Oxford, an honorary researcher at UCL Institute of Health Informatics, a visiting researcher at the British Heart Foundation's Data Science Centre via HDR UK, a member of the CVD-COVID-UK Consortium, and a core contributor to the Turing PPL and wider Julia community.

Outside of academia Harry is an enthusiastic pianist, composer and producer. He also enjoys cooking, mountain biking and hiking.

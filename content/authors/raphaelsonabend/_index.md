Raphael is a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London and the University of Kaiserslautern. His research interests include machine learning/artificial intelligence, survival analysis, ethics in AI, and model validation/benchmarking. He is primarily based in Imperial’s COVID-19 response team, modelling the trajectory of COVID-19 for the UK government...but he misses tackling the challenges of machine learning in survival analysis.

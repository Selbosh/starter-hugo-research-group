Kaiserslautern has an international flair and is situated close to the French and Luxembourgian borders. This town lies in the middle of the low-lying mountain range known as the Pf√§lzerwald, or Palatinate Forest. The science centre is renowned for technology and innovation. With everything close at hand, it's an ideal place to study.

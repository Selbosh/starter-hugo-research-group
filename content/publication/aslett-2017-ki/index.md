abstract: As the size of engineered systems grows, problems in reliability theory
  can become computationally challenging, often due to the combinatorial growth in
  the number of cut sets. In this paper we demonstrate how Multilevel Monte Carlo
  (MLMC) --- a simulation approach which is typically used for stochastic differential
  equation models --- can be applied in reliability problems by carefully controlling
  the bias-variance tradeoff in approximating large system behaviour. In this first
  exposition of MLMC methods in reliability problems we address the canonical problem
  of estimating the expectation of a functional of system lifetime for non-repairable
  and repairable components, demonstrating the computational advantages compared to
  classical Monte Carlo methods. The difference in computational complexity can be
  orders of magnitude for very large or complicated system structures, or where the
  desired precision is lower.

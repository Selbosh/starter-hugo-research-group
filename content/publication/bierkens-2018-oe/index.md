abstract: One of the main technical challenges associated with likelihood-based inference
  for big data is the fact that likelihood calculation is computationally expensive
  (typically O ( N ) for data sets of size N ). MCMC methods built from piecewise
  deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) offer …

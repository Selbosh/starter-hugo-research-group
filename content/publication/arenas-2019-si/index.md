abstract: We present a policy and process framework for secure environments for productive
  data science research projects at scale, by combining prevailing data security threat
  and risk profiles into five sensitivity tiers, and, at each tier, specifying recommended
  policies for data classification, data ingress, software ingress, data egress, user
  access, user device control, and analysis environments. By presenting design patterns
  for security choices for each tier, and using software defined infrastructure so
  that a different, independent, secure research environment can be instantiated for
  each project appropriate to its classification, we hope to maximise researcher productivity
  and minimise risk, allowing research organisations to operate with confidence.

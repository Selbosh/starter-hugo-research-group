abstract: Rough sleeping is a chronic problem faced by some of the most disadvantaged
  people in modern society. This paper describes work carried out in partnership with
  Homeless Link, a UK-based charity, in developing a data-driven approach to assess
  the quality of incoming alerts from members of the public aimed at connecting people
  sleeping rough on the streets with outreach service providers. Alerts are prioritised
  based on the predicted likelihood of successfully connecting with the rough sleeper,
  helping to address capacity limitations and to quickly, effectively, and equitably
  process all of the alerts that they receive. Initial evaluation concludes that our
  approach increases the rate at which rough sleepers are found following a referral
  by at least 15% based on labelled data, implying a greater overall increase when
  the alerts with unknown outcomes are considered, and suggesting the benefit in a
  trial taking place over a longer period to assess the models in practice. The discussion
  and modelling process is done with careful considerations of ethics, transparency
  and explainability due to the sensitive nature of the data in this context and the
  vulnerability of the people that are affected.

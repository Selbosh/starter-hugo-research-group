abstract: 'During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, digital technologies
  have become a major route for accessing remote care. Therefore, the need to ensure
  that these tools are safe and effective has never been greater. We raise five calls
  to action to ensure the safety, availability, and long-term sustainability of these
  technologies: (1) due diligence: remove harmful health apps from app stores; (2)
  data insights: use relevant health data insights from high-quality digital tools
  to inform the greater response to COVID-19; (3) freely available resources: make
  high-quality digital health tools available without charge, where possible, and
  for as long as possible, especially to those who are most vulnerable; (4) digital
  transitioning: transform conventional offline mental health services to make them
  digitally available; and (5) population self-management: encourage governments and
  insurers to work with developers to look at how digital health management could
  be subsidized or funded. We believe this should be carried out at the population
  level, rather than at a prescription level.'

Data science touches upon technical areas such as mathematics, statistics and computer science as well as various applications such as in the biomedical sciences, industrial applications, business, social sciences and natural sciences. It can be viewed as a vehicle establishing methodology that is vital for the connection between methodology and applications and which ultimately allows for the sciences to have an impact in real-world applications. 
Initially the focus of  four major streams:
- Bayesian methodology and Monte Carlo Methods: the development of novel methodologies and the extension of established theoretical works pertaining to machine learning.
- Machine Learning in Julia: I  of the software package Machine Learning in Julia (MLJ), a modelling toolbox providing a common interface and meta-algorithms for selecting, tuning, evaluating and building composite models.
- Applications of machine learning with a focus on health care:  The research group has applied these methodologies to develop tools to generate actionable insights to inform the British governmentâ€™s response to COVID-19, perform treatment selection for diabetes and predict emergency admissions in Scotland.
- Data Science for Social Good: We use our knowledge in these areas to champion new ways of delivering impact, through short term collaborations with industrial, nonprofit and academic partners to address real-world challenges in programs that combine training and delivery.
